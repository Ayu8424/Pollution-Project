# Pollution Analysis Project üåçüí®

# Overview
This project analyzes air pollution levels across different cities using historical pollution data. The goal is to identify trends, visualize key pollutants, and derive meaningful insights using Python and data science techniques.

# The Questions

1Ô∏è‚É£ *How does pollution vary across different cities? (City-wise pollution level analysis)*

2Ô∏è‚É£ *What are the long-term trends in pollution levels over time? (Analyzing pollution patterns over the years)*

3Ô∏è‚É£ *How do pollution levels change on a monthly basis? (Monthly trends in pollutant concentrations)*

4Ô∏è‚É£ *What relationships exist between different pollutants? (Correlation analysis to identify key pollutant interactions)*

5Ô∏è‚É£ *How have pollution levels changed over the years? (Studying pollutant trends from past to present)*

6Ô∏è‚É£ *Which are the top 10 most polluted cities based on PM2.5 levels? (Identifying the worst-affected cities by air pollution)*

# What I learned
As this is my First ever project with Python Pandas after giving 1 month dedicately towards learning Python and Python Libraries. This project helped me improve my data analysis skills and understand air pollution trends better. Here are some key takeaways:

**Working with Python Libraries:** I improved my skills in Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualizing trends effectively.

**The Importance of Data Cleaning:** I realized how crucial it is to clean and prepare data properly before analysis to get accurate results.

**Understanding Pollution Trends:** Analyzing pollution over time helped me see patterns, seasonal variations, and the impact of different pollutants on air quality.

Overall, this project was a great learning experience that strengthened my skills in data handling, visualization, and interpretation

# Results & Findings
High pollution levels in major cities üö¶
Seasonal variations observed ‚ùÑÔ∏è‚òÄÔ∏è
PM2.5 & PM10 have strong correlations with traffic and industrial activities

# Challenges I faced:
This project came with its own set of challenges, but each one was a great learning experience:

**Handling Missing & Inconsistent Data:** Cleaning the data was tricky because some entries were missing or inconsistent. I had to carefully process and refine the dataset to ensure accurate analysis.

**Creating Clear Visualizations:** Representing complex data in a simple and understandable way was challenging. I had to experiment with different charts and graphs to effectively highlight key insights.

**Finding the Right Balance:** It was difficult to decide how deep to go into each analysis while still covering a broad view of the data. I had to ensure that the project remained detailed yet easy to follow.

Despite these challenges, this project was a great learning opportunity, helping me improve my data cleaning, visualization, and analytical thinking skills. 

# Conclusion
This analysis helped us understand air pollution trends in different cities. We found that Delhi, Patna, Gurugram, and Lucknow are among the most polluted cities, with PM2.5 and PM10 being the major pollutants affecting air quality.
Pollution levels were highest between 2015-2018 but started improving after 2019. The trend shows that pollution decreases in the middle of the year, stays stable for a while, and then rises towards the end of the year. While air quality has improved over time, some cities still struggle with high pollution levels.
